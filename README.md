# Event-Management

This project provides a simple frontend for managing events. It allows users to view upcoming events, track the time remaining until an event starts with a countdown timer, and submit the RSVP details.

## Features

- Displays upcoming event details such as date, location, and description.
- A dynamic countdown timer updates in real-time to show the time left until the event begins.
- An RSVP form where users can submit their name, email, and the number of guests attending.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Defines the structure of the webpage, including elements like headings, paragraphs, forms, and sections for the event details.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the webpage by controlling the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness, ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, such as dynamically updating the countdown timer every second and enabling real-time user interactions (like form submission validation).
